## About The Project

![Landing page Screenshot](public/svg-editor.jpg)

I build svg editor with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. In which you can customise your SVG however you want.
<br>
you can also add different tile in background of svg.
<br/>
Like : Square, Squircle, Circle, Beacon

- you can also control their size, border radius and change colors.

<br/>
  It also has different color options :

- Monochrome : Saturation can be adjusted.
- Gray Scale : Gray tone can be adjusted.

After filling your svg with your talent you can download updated svg.

Here's why:

- to develop a better understanding of SVGs.
- as well as to learn how to modify svgs in HTML.

Use your creativity and color talent to make your SVG more attractive.
